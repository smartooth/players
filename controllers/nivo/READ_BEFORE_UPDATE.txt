File in question: jquery.nivo.slider.js

Check Line _373_ of current version (2.6) as this modification should be applied to the next version upon updating... unless this functionality has been added in the update.

The modification forces Nivo's animations to respect the direction the slider is advancing... the most logical functionality from a UI perspective.

Also, transfer custom.css to the updated set of nivo slider files.
